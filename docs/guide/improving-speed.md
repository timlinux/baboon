# Improving Your Typing Speed

Ready to type faster? This guide covers proven techniques to boost your WPM while maintaining accuracy.

## The Speed Formula

```
Speed = Accuracy × Efficiency × Consistency
```

You need all three to truly improve. Let's break each down.

## Building Accuracy First

!!! warning "Golden Rule"
    **Never sacrifice accuracy for speed.** Speed built on poor technique will plateau and create bad habits.

### Why Accuracy First?

- Mistakes require backspace + retype = time lost
- Errors break rhythm and flow
- Muscle memory learns what you practice (including mistakes!)

### Target Accuracy Progression

| Phase | Target Accuracy | WPM Focus |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Foundation | 98%+ | Any speed |
| Building | 95%+ | Push +10% |
| Maintenance | 93%+ | Push +15% |
| Speed trials | 90%+ | Maximum |

## Technique Improvements

### Proper Finger Positioning

Your fingers should hover over the home row:

```
     Q W E R T   Y U I O P
      A S D F G H J K L
       Z X C V B N M
         [___Space___]

Left:  (pinky)(ring)(middle)(index)
Right: (index)(middle)(ring)(pinky)
```

**Key points**:

- Index fingers feel for the F and J bumps
- Fingers curve naturally
- Wrists float, don't rest

### Minimise Movement

Every unnecessary movement costs time:

- Keep fingers close to home row
- Return fingers after reaching
- Use the correct finger for each key
- Don't "hover" over keys

### Light Touch

Heavy key presses are slower:

- Use minimal force needed
- Let the keyboard do the work
- Mechanical keyboards can help

## Building Speed

### The 10% Rule

Increase speed gradually:

1. Establish comfortable, accurate pace
2. Push 10% faster
3. Accept temporary accuracy drop
4. Practice until accuracy recovers
5. Repeat

### Bursts vs Sustained

**Burst practice**: Type as fast as possible for one word

- Good for building maximum speed
- Trains fast-twitch response

**Sustained practice**: Maintain consistent pace

- Builds endurance
- Develops rhythm

Mix both in your practice!

### Word Chunking

Expert typists don't type letters - they type words:

- See "the" → type "the" as a unit
- Common words become single actions
- Practice recognising word shapes

## Specific Exercises

### Exercise 1: Home Row Mastery

Practice words using only home row keys:

```
add, sad, dad, fad, ash, dash, flask, salad
```

**Goal**: 100% accuracy, then build speed

### Exercise 2: Reach Practice

Top row reaching:

```
type, write, query, power, route
```

Bottom row reaching:

```
exam, combine, zone, box, next
```

### Exercise 3: Weak Finger Focus

Check your stats for weak fingers, then practice:

**Left pinky (Q, A, Z)**:

```
quiz, amazing, zone, aqua, plaza
```

**Right pinky (P)**:

```
people, paper, pepper, purpose, loop
```

### Exercise 4: Bigram Drills

Practice common two-letter combinations:

```
th: the, that, them, think
er: were, her, every, never
on: one, only, done, gone
an: and, any, can, man
```

### Exercise 5: Same-Finger Bigram Training

SFBs are speed killers. Practice them specifically:

```
de: decide, beside, define
ed: edited, needed, seeded
un: under, until, unless
nu: number, menu, annual
```

## Rhythm and Flow

### Consistent Rhythm

Uneven typing wastes energy:

- Aim for even spacing between keystrokes
- Use internal counting: "1-2-3-4"
- Check your StdDev metric

### Reducing Pauses

Common pause points:

- Start of new word
- Unfamiliar letter sequences
- After corrections

**Practice**: Focus on smooth transitions between words.

### Flow State

When typing feels effortless:

- Don't think about individual letters
- Let muscle memory take over
- Words flow as whole units

## Using Baboon Effectively

### Warm-up Rounds

Start each session with 2-3 easy rounds:

- Focus on accuracy
- Get into rhythm
- Wake up muscle memory

### Push Rounds

After warm-up, push for speed:

- Accept 90%+ accuracy temporarily
- Focus on flow
- Don't look at the WPM bar

### Cool-down

End with 1-2 accuracy-focused rounds:

- Reinforce good technique
- End on a positive note

### Tracking Progress

Use Baboon's statistics to monitor:

| Metric | What to Track |
|--------|---------------|
| WPM Average | Weekly trend |
| Accuracy Average | Should stay >95% |
| Letter Heatmap | Weak letters improving? |
| StdDev | Getting more consistent? |

## Common Plateaus

### Plateau: 30-40 WPM

**Cause**: Still thinking about individual letters

**Fix**:

- Focus on word recognition
- Practice high-frequency words
- Trust your muscle memory

### Plateau: 50-60 WPM

**Cause**: Inconsistent rhythm or weak fingers

**Fix**:

- Work on rhythm consistency (reduce StdDev)
- Target weak fingers specifically
- Practice smoothing word transitions

### Plateau: 70-80 WPM

**Cause**: Same-finger bigrams and complex sequences

**Fix**:

- Study your SFB statistics
- Practice difficult bigrams
- Work on anticipatory typing

## Mental Aspects

### Don't Watch the WPM

Constantly checking the bar:

- Breaks concentration
- Creates anxiety
- Disrupts flow

Trust the process - check stats after the round.

### Relax

Tension slows you down:

- Relax your shoulders
- Soften your hands
- Breathe normally

### Stay Positive

Every session builds improvement:

- Bad rounds are practice
- Mistakes are learning
- Progress isn't linear

## Advanced Techniques

### Anticipatory Typing

Looking ahead while typing current word:

- Use the word carousel
- Eyes move ahead of fingers
- Brain prepares next word

### Predictive Finger Positioning

Preparing fingers before needed:

- Common sequences become automatic
- Fingers move during other keystrokes
- Reduces effective seek time

### Minimising Corrections

Better to finish and move on:

- Quick backspace for recent errors
- Don't hunt for old mistakes
- Forward momentum matters

## Quick Reference

### Daily Practice (15 min)

1. 2 warm-up rounds (accuracy focus)
2. 2 push rounds (speed focus)
3. 1 cool-down round (accuracy)

### Weekly Goals

- [ ] Beat average WPM by 2-3
- [ ] Maintain 95%+ accuracy average
- [ ] Improve one weak letter
- [ ] Reduce rhythm StdDev

### Long-term Milestones

| Phase | WPM | Accuracy | Timeline |
|-------|-----|----------|----------|
| Beginner → Intermediate | 40 | 95% | 2-4 weeks |
| Intermediate → Good | 60 | 95% | 4-8 weeks |
| Good → Fast | 80 | 95% | 2-4 months |
| Fast → Expert | 100+ | 95% | 6+ months |
